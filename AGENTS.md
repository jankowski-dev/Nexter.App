# Nexter — Agent Guide

This file is for AI agents working in this repository.

The full implementation contract is [`docs/mega-prompt.md`](docs/mega-prompt.md). Read it before starting any task.

## Current phase

Phase 1 — Foundation.

Do not implement auth, accounting, imports, or swap features until Phase 1 is reviewed and accepted.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. No private keys, seed phrases, or signing keys on the server.
2. No public signup.
3. No wallet connection in MVP-1.
4. No swap execution in MVP-1.
5. Money is always decimal strings / Postgres `numeric`; never JS number/float.
6. Every mutation must be audited.
7. The ledger is append-only; corrections are new transactions.
8. No secrets in code, prompts, logs, or screenshots.
9. Agents have no production access.
10. Schema changes require an ADR and review.
11. Tests, typecheck, and lint must pass before merge.
12. UI is Russian, dark theme, USD base currency.
13. BSC first, Ethereum second.
14. Swap tokens are allowlisted.
15. Step-up TOTP is required for swaps above $500.
16. Do not change acceptance tests to make them pass.
17. Do not invent financial or tax logic.
18. If something is unclear, stop and ask.
